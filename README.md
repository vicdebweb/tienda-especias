# Spice Store (Practice Project)

This is a fictitious spice store website developed as a practice project.

## Project Overview

The website simulates an online spice store, featuring:

- A responsive design with a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
- Smooth CSS animations and hover effects to enhance user experience.
- A basic contact form implemented in PHP for server-side processing.
- Clean and semantic HTML5 structure.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for page structure.
- **CSS3** including Flexbox and responsive media queries for layout and styling.
- **JavaScript** for interactive elements like the responsive menu toggle.
- **PHP** for the contact form handling (server-side).

## How to Use

- Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the static parts of the website.
- To use the contact form, upload the project to a web server that supports PHP, as GitHub Pages does **not** support PHP.

## View Online

The static version of this site is available online via GitHub Pages at:

## Notes

- The PHP contact form is basic and intended for demonstration purposes only.
- Images and assets are included for completeness.
- This project is intended for educational and portfolio purposes.
